## Usage

To install library locally for the current user, from the amazonia root directory use:

`make install`

Alternatively, you can use:

`pip3 install -e . --user`

Note: this will install all of the dependencies for the project. The dependencies list can be found in the setup.py file in the 'Install Requires:' section.

To generate cloud formation using amazonia, you need to provide two yaml documents. One containing any application specific details and another for the environmental defaults.

Amazonia will read the two yaml documets and give priority to the application specific yaml, meaning that the defaults can be overridden in the application specific yaml if required. Because of this, it is best to set as many defaults as possible to ensure the best functionality out of this library.

See the yaml files in the amazonia folder for a guide showing all possible yaml variables and the expected types of contents. Schema is used to validate the combined application and defaults yaml before execution.

If no custom yaml files are provided, amazonia will read from amazonia/application.yaml and amazonia/defaults.yaml.

Once you have both of your yaml documents, you can run amazonia using the below command

`python3 amazonia/amz.py -y APPLICATION_YAML_LOCATION -d ENVIRONMENTAL_DEFAULT_YAML_LOCATION`

#### amz.py options


    usage: amz.py [-h] [-y YAML] [-d DEFAULT] [-s SCHEMA] [-t TEMPLATE] [-o]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -y YAML, --yaml       Path to the applications amazonia yaml file
      -d DEFAULT, --default
                            Path to the environmental defaults yaml file
      -s SCHEMA, --schema
                            Path to the schema to validate the provided yaml
                            values against
      -t TEMPLATE, --template
                            Path for amazonia to place template file
      -o, --out             Output template to stdout rather than a file.


## Contributions

For any contributions, please feel free to fork, or branch this repo from the integration branch.
All Pull requests should also be aimed at the integration branch. 
This is because the integration branch is where our tests run before we merge to master so this is super helpful to us :)

##Examples

#### Quick Start

Follow these steps to create a working stack using Amazonia:

1. Clone the master branch of this repo.
2. Change the KeyPair yaml variable in the amazonia/application.yaml file. This needs to be the name of an existing key pair in your AWS space. See YAML key tips at the bottom of this readme for more info.
3. Change directory to the amazonia folder and run amz.py with no arguments: `Python3 amz.py`
4. Create a stack using the stack.template file that is generated.

This will create the following resources:

- 1 x Internet Gateway
- 1 x VPC Gateway Attachment
- 1 x Jump Box (for ssh access into your environment)
- 1 x NAT (Internet access from your app server will pass through this)
- 1 x Autoscaling group (min/max 1 instance. This will be your app server)
- 1 x Launch configuration for the above autoscaling group.
- 6 x subnets (3 public, 3 private)
- 1 x Load Balancer
- 4 x security groups (1 for load balancer, 1 for Autoscaling group, 1 for NAT, 1 for Jump box)
- Route tables, routing and security group rules for all of the above.

## YAML key tips

#### keypair
The `keypair` value is required to be a valid [key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) name in your AWS space. This value is *not* created by the Cloud Formation Template generated by Amazonia.
